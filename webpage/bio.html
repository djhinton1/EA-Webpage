        <!--Paragraphs talking about me-->
        		<font face="arial" color="white"><p>Although the University of Pittsburgh is my new home, my permanent address still reads Merrillville, Indiana. I grew up there, about 45 minuts outside of Chicago and contrary to the popular "Indiana Corn" stereotype, Merrillville was a relatively urbanized rendition of the state. Besides my parents, I have a younger brother, Justin, and a very hyper airedale terrier named Oliver. Music is a very large part of my life--I learned to play the violin when I was 6 years old and it has stuck with me for the past 13 years. I find that it is an excellent way to relieve tension and stress especially when it comes to college exams. I've managed to travel a bit while I was younger; one of my favorite places being Cozumel, Mexico, and I hope to do a lot more traveling in my future.</p>
		
		<p>I am a hardworking student who does well under pressure and in environments of high stress. In fact, I like to work around people and bustling environments--which, I know, is strange. My ability to stay organized in the midst of chaos allows me to stay focused and pay attention to the details. For example, when perfecting a violin performance, it is necessary to just look over the sheet music; not even touching the instrument. I always found it easier to pick out small improvements when I was surrounded by people, nature, or the television.</p>
		
		<p>Even though I was hesitant about coming to the University of Pittsburgh, it has turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made. The engineering curriculum here is very challenging, which is good in my case because I like to be challenged, and it still feels like city living just a bid more relaxed and on a smaller scale. I am optimistic about the future and I know that my four years here are going to be some good ones.</font></p>
