 <!--why i like college-->
 	<font color="orange" size="5">
 	<h2 align="center">Why I Love This College</h2>
 	
 	<dl>
 		
 		<dt><u><font size="6">Education</font></u></dt>
 			<dd>Pitt is consistently ranked high on the national school list of public colleges, especially when it comes to engineering. I wanted to go somewhere where I knew I would be getting a good education and would increase my competitiveness when applying for jobs.</dd>
 			
 		<dt><u><font size="6">Location</font></u></dt>
 			<dd>The area of Pittsburgh has a lot of cultural amenities. I think that it is important to be exposed to different kinds of cultural influences to be able to see things from a different perspective. I also like that the area has a lot of old history. It makes me feel somehow connected to the past.<dd>
 			
 		<dt><u><font size="6">Cost</font></u></dt>
 			<dd>The university of Pittsburgh ended up being the most cost effective university for me to go to, so I had to make a decision to follow my gut. It was important to me that my parents not be burdened with the cost of my education.</dd>
 			
 		<dt><u><font size="6">People</font></u></dt>
 			<dd>In college, students today are surrounded by people from all over the globe. It is very easy to meet people from other parts of the world and learn about different cultures and traditions. 
 		
 		<dt><u><font size="6">Food</font></u></dt>
 			<dd>From what I hear, Pittsburgh is the food capital of the United States and from what I have had so far, I would agree. My favorite place is Dave and Andy's ice cream Parlor. Ice cream is literally my favorite dessert so its nice to have such a good quality place close to the university.</dd>
 			
 		<dt><u><font size="6">Future</font></u></dt>
 			<dd>Going to college pretty much guarantees a better quality of life after graduation so I am excited to see where this degree will take me and what opportunities will open up in the future.</dd>
