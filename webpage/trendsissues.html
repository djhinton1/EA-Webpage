<h2><u>My Future as a Professional Engineer</u></h2>	
	<p>Anyone in the field of engineering that is trying to make money needs to be a certified professional engineer. The certification proves that the holder is competent and is reliably knowledgeable about relevant engineering topics. Without the CPE certification, safety comes into question and weather or not a person without a certification is qualified enough to solve pertinent engineering problems. To become licensed, engineers must complete a four-year college degree, work under a Professional Engineer for at least four years, pass two intensive competency exams and earn a license from their state's licensure board. Then, to retain their licenses, PEs must continually maintain and improve their skills throughout their careers.
